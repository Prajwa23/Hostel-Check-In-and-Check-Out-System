The Hostel Check-in and Check-out System is a comprehensive solution designed to manage and track student entry and exit activities efficiently. This system aims to ensure accurate recording of check-in and check-out
times, providing a secure and transparent process for both students and hostel administrators. By leveraging a structured database, the system maintains detailed logs of student activity, which can be accessed for 
monitoring, reporting, and compliance purposes. 
The system enhances operational efficiency by automating routine tasks such as time logging, record management, and access control. It minimizes errors associated with manual tracking and ensures that all data is 
securely stored for future reference. This system also supports features like alerts for overdue check-outs and real-time updates on student presence, improving overall safety and accountability within the hostel 
premises. 
By integrating technology into the management process, this solution not only streamlines administrative workflows but also contributes to a more organized and student-friendly hostel environment.
